Table 2 provides an overview of reproduction and replication types, or more generally “repetitive research” [@Schoch2023], drawn from different resources (e.g., [@DreberJohannesson2024]; [@HueffmeierEtAl2016]; for an alternative taxonomy see also [@CortinaEtAl2023]). The decision between these types is the first step in planning.\n\nIn addition, the formation of the replication team is important, as replications can take substantial resources.

There can be other studies citing the original studies, criticizing them, disconfirming their underlying theory, identifying errors, reinterpreting the finding, or making suggestions for replications. All of these might highlight considerations that need to be taken into account when designing a replication study that *robustly* tests the original claim or its generalisability.\n\nThus, replication researchers should look for post-publication discussions on the target study such as published comments and reviews, blog posts, or discussions on social media. These can often be found via Altmetric (<https://www.altmetric.com>) or other tools that allow researchers to quickly identify discussions on social media or news outlets beyond scientific journals ([PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com), [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is)), or the in-development platform [Alphaxiv.org](https://www.alphaxiv.org/); for a review see [@HenriquesEtAl2023].\n\n## ***Reproduction before Replication*** {#reproduction-before-replication}\n\nMany features of a replication study rest on the correctness of the original report. A reproduction allows researchers to investigate this by being able to uncover coding errors, fraud, robustness to analytical decisions, and generalizability. To make efficient use of resources, we encourage researchers to investigate the original finding’s reproducibility and robustness first. In other words, ideally, reproductions should take place before planning and conducting a replication study. Depending on the availability of the code and data, these can take several minutes to weeks.\n\nIf the original code and dataset are available, researchers can try to *numerically reproduce* the results. Beware, however, that differences in software versions or default settings may lead to slight deviations or require corrections in some cases (for a large-scale test of reproducibility see [@BrodeurEtAl2024b]). Similarly, the lack of a set seed for random number generators can mean that analyses relying on random numbers (e.g., bootstrapping) cannot be exactly reproduced. If no analysis script is available, analyses need to be recreated from the descriptions in the report (*recoding reproduction*). In this case, special attention should be paid to processing steps such as exclusion of outliers, transformation of variables, and handling of missing data. However, in many research areas information on these steps is often incomplete [@FieldEtAl2019]; older research tends to be especially limited in terms of the methodological details they provide. In addition, we recommend testing the robustness of the original finding by making small alterations to the data processing and analyses procedure (*robustness reproductions*). For example, if the analyses were run for a subset of the data (e.g., participants aged 21 to 30 or without outliers ± 3 standard deviations), this subset can be changed (e.g., participants aged 18 to 30 or without outliers ± 2 standard deviations). Here, the initial focus should be on choices that are not determined by the *theory* that is presented, though this can also be used to explore the generalisability of some aspects of theory. Finally, if the original study was preregistered and the original code is available, reproduction researchers can check whether the original analyses adhere to the preregistered analysis plan.\n\nIf neither code nor data are available (or shared by the authors), no reproduction is possible. Researchers can still use automated tools to compare reported *p*-values with those that can be computed from test statistics via the website statcheck.io (where documents may be uploaded), the corresponding R package [@NuijtenPolanin2020], or papercheck [@DeBruineLakens2025], which is still actively maintained.\n\n**Figure 3**\\\n![Decision tree to choose between types of reproductions depending on available code and data.](img/YAJ_Image_3.png)\n\n## ***Close replication before conceptual replication*** {#close-replication-before-conceptual-replication}\n\nIf the goal is to increase the generalizability of a specific finding, we also suggest starting with replications that adhere as close as possible to the original study (e.g., close replications) and only later conduct conceptual replications. Based on Hüffmeier, Mazei, and Schultze [@HueffmeierEtAl2016], we propose the typology and order of replication attempts in Figure 3. Importantly, replications at any stage should not compromise any aspects of an original study, but rather (at the latest from the third study stage \\[constructive replications\\] onwards) try to improve one or more aspects of the original study, such as “\\[…\\] more valid measures, more critical control variables, a more realistic task, a more representative sample, or a design that allows for stronger conclusions regarding causality”, see Köhler & Cortina [@KohlerCortina2021, p. 494]. Köhler and Cortina term such replications “constructive replications” and caution against the conduct of “quasi-random” replications that vary features without clear rationale.\n\nFinally, there may be cases where the sequence of replications is not necessary, or where the context of the replication team requires a focus on generalisability to a specific context (see section [The Role of Differences for the Interpretation of Findings](#the-role-of-differences-for-the-interpretation-of-findings)).\n\n**Figure 4**\\\n![Sequence of replications from exact replications to conceptual replications under field conditions](img/BEG_Image_4.png)\n\nNote: This is an adaptation and update of the typology of replication studies by Hüffmeier, Mazei, and Schultze [@HueffmeierEtAl2016].
