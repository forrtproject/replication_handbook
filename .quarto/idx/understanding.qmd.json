However, it is important to note from the outset that there is no overarching terminology or consensus (e.g., [@VoelklEtAl2025]), as the formal development of replication methods has begun relatively late in the social, behavioral, and cognitive sciences. For example, empirical psychology is more than 100 years old, but until the advent of the replication/reproducibility crisis in the early 2010s, replication methods have been rarely discussed (e.g., [@King1995]). Different fields of research seem to tackle the task differently and independently, which has led to multiple overlapping terminologies across psychology [@Schmidt2009; @HueffmeierEtAl2016], management [@TsangKwan1999], marketing [@UrminskyDietvorst2024], organizational sciences [@KohlerCortina2021], computer sciences [@HerouxEtAl2018], language learning [@McManus2024], and the humanities [@Schoch2023].\n\n\nThe terms reproduction and replication are used in different ways between disciplines; for example, in psychology, studies using different data are commonly referred to as replications and studies using the same data are referred to as reproductions, whereas in other fields, such as computational science or economics, these terms may be used in the opposite manner or treated interchangeably (see [@MilkowskiEtAl2018; @AnkelPetersEtAl2023]). In this paper, replication is used to refer to efforts involving the analysis of different data, and reproduction to efforts involving the same data. The different data do not necessarily need to be from a different sample but can also constitute distinct (non-overlapping) subsets from the same sample (e.g., incidental or panel data; [@HuangHuang2024]).\n\nReproduction and replication should always be considered together and if possible, reproduction should come before replication. This is because, at the early stages of research, reproduction is much more cost efficient; first confirming whether the findings are reproducible can clarify whether a replication is worthwhile. Furthermore, if the research procedure consists of “moving away” from a specific finding in terms of changing the analysis code, materials, and dataset to test its generalizability or boundary conditions, a numerical reproduction (using the same data and same code) is the closest possible repetition of a finding and a useful foundation for further steps. We discuss multiple cases to illustrate the relationship between reproduction and replication in Table 1:\n\n**Table 1**\n\n*Possible combinations of reproduction and replication outcomes.*\n\n| Case | Reproducible? | Replicable? | Possible interpretation |\n|----|----|----|:---|\n| A | Yes | Yes | The original finding is reproducible and generalizable. |\n| B | Yes | No | The original finding is reproducible but not generalizable. |\n| C | No | Yes | The original finding is not reproducible but replicators could determine a scenario where it holds. |\n| D | No | No | The original finding is neither reproducible nor generalizable. |\n\n*Note*. A similar distinction is made by The Turing Way Community [@TheTuringWayCommunity2025] but uses a less specific terminology for reproductions.\n\n## ***Outcome*** {#outcome}\n\nCommon language often conflates outcome and study descriptions: researchers typically use the phrase “has been replicated” to refer to a replication attempt that has corroborated the findings of the original study, whereas “failed to replicate” or “could not be replicated” is used to refer to circumstances where a replication attempt has not corroborated the original results or has led to a different interpretation or conclusions (see also [@PatilEtAl2016a]).\n\nIn this article, when we state that a “study was reproduced/replicated” we mean that there has been a replication attempt, irrespective of its outcome. With “replicable” and “reproducible” we express that there was support for the original hypothesis. Note that the outcome of a replication/reproduction study is often not straightforward, but may depend on the success criteria applied. This is discussed in section [Defining and Determining Replication Success](#defining-and-determining-replication-success).\n\n## ***Types of replication*** {#types-of-replication}\n\nWe heavily rely on the typology provided by Hüffmeier et al. [@HueffmeierEtAl2016] where different types of replications are defined by the closeness or similarity between original and replication study. Similarity cannot be evaluated without a theory about the concepts involved. For example, the concept of age can differ strongly between replications of historical, psychological, or biological studies, leading to different measures of the concept itself and thus different judgments about the similarity of an object’s age.\n\nUnder the assumption of a stable world and constant laws or regularities that are investigated by the social, behavioral, and cognitive sciences, a reproduction and replication study’s closeness to an original study is associated with replication ‘success’ [@HueffmeierEtAl2016; @LeBelEtAl2018] (see the discussion section for an in-depth discussion of success criteria). The argument can be made from two different philosophical perspectives that we call inductive (phenomenon-focused, effects application, bottom-up) and deductive (theory-focused, theory application, top down; e.g., [@CalderEtAl1981]; [@BorgstedeScholz2021]). From an inductive perspective, a replication that is very similar to an original study should lead to the same result whereas one that differs with respect to any criterion may lead to different results. This is a stance often taken by proponents of findings that failed to replicate (e.g., [@BaumeisterVohs2016]; [@Syed2023]), arguing that characteristics such as time or place are different and can be valid reasons for different results. From a deductive (theory-focused) view, the only changes that matter are those that affect the underlying theory. Consider for example a replication experiment that is identical in every aspect except for the season (summer instead of winter). If the theory that is tested is about color perception, the replication is likely judged to be close to the original study but if it is about participants’ current tea preferences, it is likely judged to be different from the original study in a theoretically relevant aspect.[^understanding-1]\n\n[^understanding-1]: On a different note, Vohs et al. [@VohsEtAl2021] published a study that was different from previous studies in that it did not replicate any previous study but was instead designed to be ideal to test the theory and estimate the average effect size and termed it “paradigmatic replication approach”. Given the present terminology, we do not consider this a replication.\n\nA related dimension of closeness concerns contextual sensitivity—the extent to which the meaning of a questionnaire or the effect of a manipulation depends on time, culture, or population. As Van Bavel et al. (2016) demonstrate, studies on contextually sensitive topics were significantly less likely to replicate successfully in Open Science Collaboration [@OpenScienceCollab2015], even though methodological fidelity was high. This raises important questions about what constitutes a “close” replication: Should a study on celebrity attitudes, for example, use the same examples (which may be outdated and thus psychologically inert), or should it adapt to locally and temporarily salient figures to trigger the same cognitive or emotional responses? In such cases, strict methodological similarity might paradoxically undermine theoretical closeness, and thus the validity of the replication attempt. This tension highlights that procedural fidelity does not always equate to theoretical equivalence—particularly for studies involving social meaning, identity, or temporally anchored norms. LeBel et al. [@LeBelEtAl2018] (Figure X) provide a taxonomy for classifying a replication study’s closeness for psychological research.\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n![Taxonomy for classifying a replication study’s methodological similarity to an original study. Reprinted from LeBel et al. (2018) with permission.](img/CDe_Image_2.png) Support for the view that methodological features that are theoretically irrelevant such as the use of text versus image stimuli or the type of sample can have a strong impact on the results is provided by Landy et al. [@LandyEtAl2020], who let different groups of researchers test identical hypotheses using different study designs. The groups arrived at entirely different and even opposite conclusions for similar hypotheses. The differences in the study designs were not predicted by the theories involved in the respective studies: A priori, none of the differences (e.g., within- vs. between-subjects design, picture vs. text stimuli) “should” have affected the conclusions. Note that other theories such as demand characteristics (Orne, 2017) could help in these cases. Moreover, this does not disconfirm the deductive perspective but may be a demonstration of the lack of specification of theories - as well as a reminder that statistical choices affect statistical power by changing the variance, and thus standardised effect sizes. In line with deviations from original studies mostly having uncertain consequences, close replications more directly test the credibility of original results, while conceptual replications that vary features of the design are concerned with generalizability.\n\nNote that Nosek and Errington [@NosekErrington2020] define replication as a study “for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research”. This can lead to issues when the original claim is not clear on its boundary conditions. Conceptual replications that highlight limitations to the claim made clearly count, e.g. when the original claim was about a universal effect, and the replication shows that it does not hold in a specific country. Conversely, “replications” that go beyond the claim made, and test the transferability of a claim explicitly made about, e.g., maths education to science education may indeed serve to be framed differently, as they do not directly speak to the claim made originally. Where original authors failed to specify the scope of their claim, we would understand that they imply a broad/universally applicable relationship, which any attempts at generalisation help to corroborate or specify.\n\nIn terms of Schöch [@Schoch2023], who defines an overarching type of repetitive research based on multiple dimensions, replications are concerned with the same question as a previous study, use the same (close replication) or a similar (conceptual replication) method and use different data (otherwise they are reproductions).\n\n## ***Types of reproduction*** {#types-of-reproduction}\n\nReproductions can be numerical reproductions, testing whether the same data, code and software lead to the same results, or robustness reproductions, extending the original analysis and exploring the central finding’s limits [@DreberJohannesson2024]. Most reproductions would include both a numerical reproduction as baseline and then a robustness reproduction, unless the numerical reproduction is not possible due to a lack of code or software.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nIn this guide, we focus on studies that re-examine a previously tested hypothesis and refer to them as repetitions (i.e., reproductions and replications) with the general field being called repetitive research as suggested by Schöch [@Schoch2023].
