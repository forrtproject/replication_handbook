# Potential Conflicts of Interest

A large proportion of the authors are members of FORRT, an organization dedicated to integrating open and reproducible science into higher education. LR, LW, FA, and JG are inaugural editors of the in-development journal *Replication Research* (<https://replicationresearch.org>). Besides their conviction of the value of replications, their current project’s success relies on researchers conducting reproductions and replications. LR is the managing director of an institutional open science center and proponent of repetitive research. The authors declare that they have no further potential conflicts of interest.

# Funding

LR received funding from the University of Münster and the ‘Landesinitiative openaccess.nrw’. LW and LR received funding from ‘UK Research and Innovation’. LW, HH, and FA received funding from the ‘Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek’. JG received funding by ‘Innovative Medizinische Forschung’ (IMF) of the medical faculty of the University of Münster (GO122301). HH was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Project-ID 422744262 - TRR 289 (gefördert durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - Projektnummer 422744262 - TRR 289).
